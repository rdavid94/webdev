  <h2>Attack</h2>
  <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong>spearers</strong> or <strong>smashers</strong>.</p> 
  <p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p>
  
  
  <h2>Eyesight</h2> 
  <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. </p>
  <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes it can perceive both polarized light, and colour vision outside the normal visual spectrum.</p>
